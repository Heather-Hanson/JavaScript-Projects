Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic tac toe game that allows the user to play against the computer. It demonstrates functions that allow for back and forth game play, placement of X and O and sound effects.

Calulator

This is a standard calculator. It demonstrates event listener functions to consider which operand buttons are clicked and performs the desired math.

Portfolio Website

This is the location of my latest version of my portfolio website. Functions were added to create a slideshow of images as well as a pop-up contact form.
